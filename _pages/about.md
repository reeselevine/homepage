This is my academic homepage. I'm in the PhD program at UC Santa Cruz where I work in the [LSD](https://lsd-ucsc.github.io/) group under [Tyler Sorensen](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~tsorensen/). I am interested in concurrent and distributed systems and how we can make building and testing these systems less painful. Prior to coming to UC Santa Cruz, I spent three years in industry at [Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com/) mostly writing in Scala and hacking on top of Elasticsearch.
